# What is this whole mess?

Glad you asked! As you may know, real Macs run **macOS** (if you say iOS, you can just close this tab/window and go back), and that OS is crafted specifically for those devices. Hackintoshes aim to bring as much functionality onto modern PC hardware. This is **not** a quick way to get a cheap MacBook, this should be seen only as a hobby project and never relied on unless you completely understand what you're doing *and* know how to fix things when shit goes south. If you need a daily driver MacBook, we recommend looking elsewhere like the used market on eBay, Facebook, etc. For those who are either masochists, want a challenge or want to see how far you can get, this guide is for you!
