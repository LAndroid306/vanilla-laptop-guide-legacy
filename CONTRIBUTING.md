# Contributing

This is a community ran guide which is not officially endorsed by Acidanthera. Please do not bug Acidanthera with issues about this guide. Some guidelines when contributing:

* Use your brain (please)
* Proofread your submissions
* Pull Requests can be denied if we feel it does not fit or has inaccurate information. We will generally tell you why it is rejected though or ask for revisions.
* In general, try to avoid using "non-Acidanthera" tools when possible. Generally we want to avoid use of third-party tools  - though if it's impossible otherwise, then you can link it.
* Your PR must be ran through a markdown lint and have all issues fixed.

## How to Contribute
Generally through PRs. Best way to test your commits and make sure they are formatted correctly is downloading `nodejs` and getting the gitbook-cli tools and markdownlint-cli tool. When you run `gitbook serve`, it will set up a local webserver which you can connect to to view the changes you made. `markdownlint *` will throw any errors at you about formatting as well, and `markdownlint -f *` will attempt to fix these.
