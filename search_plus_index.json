Can't wrap your head around RehabMan's confusing guides? Well, here's the vanila laptop guide for you. This guide will explain everything you need to know to hackintosh a laptop. For Windows and Linux we will use the internet install method, and for macOS we will use createinstallmedia (offline install). Before you begin KNOW YOUR HARDWARE We can't stress this enough. If you don't know your hardware and don't know how to find it, hackintoshing probably isn't for you. READ TWICE AND CAREFULLY BEFORE ASKING This is not a very welcoming community for people who do not want to do some self-study and learn from other's findings and instead wait for someone to spoon-feed them information and make things work for them. Read The Fucking Manual and work your way through it and do some intense googling. If you're ready, get to the next step. Good Luck! ðŸŽŠ "},"overview/whatdis.html":{"url":"overview/whatdis.html","title":"What is this","keywords":"","body":"What is this whole mess? Glad you asked! As you may know, real Macs run macOS (if you say iOS, you can just close this tab/window and go back), and that OS is crafted specifically for those devices. However, some of us may have been an old Mac user or uses Mac-specific applications or is used to using macOS for various reasons, but don't want to spend $$$$ on a laptop that is expensive and may break and there is no way to get data back once it's messed up cough MBP13,x+ cough. With this guide, you'll be taught how to install macOS on your intel powered laptop, and it will include the following: Overview Will it work on your hardware? What's the limitations?

Laptops with AMD CPUs are not supported because of the limitations covered in macOS limitations. CPUs that are not supported by this guide: AMD laptop CPUs Intel Pentium Intel Celeron Intel ATOM ARM devices "},"overview/macos-limits.html":{"url":"overview/macos-limits.html","title":"macOS limitations","keywords":"","body":"macOS limitations With laptops, there are several limitations regarding hardware that will not work. Low End iGPUs With macOS, support for iGPUs start at the GT2 tier, this means many low end iGPUs found on Celerons and Pentiums will not work. For a full list, see the GPU Buyers Guide Fingerprint sensors There is no way to emulate the Touch ID sensor as of currently, so fingerprint sensors will not work. Discrete GPUs 90% of discrete GPUs will not work because they are wired in a configuration that macOS doesn't support (switchable graphics). With NVIDIA discrete GPUs, this is usually called Optimus. It is not possible to utilize these dGPUs for the internal display, so it is generally advised to disable them and power them off (will be covered later in this guide.) However, in some cases, the discrete GPU powers any external outputs (HDMI, mini DisplayPort, etc.), which may or may not work; in the case that it will work, you will have to keep the card on and running. However, there are some laptops which rarely do not have switchable graphics, so the discrete card can be used (if supported by macOS), but the wiring and setup usually causes issues. AMD CPU laptops AMD CPU laptops, while theoretically able to work, are not practical for the following reasons: No CPU power management, so battery life will be bad Non-native support, requiring kernel patches, resulting in delayed updates No support for AMD integrated graphics (Radeon R5, R7, etc.) Most WiFi cards Most WiFi cards that come with laptops are not supported as they are usually Intel/Qualcomm. If you are lucky, you may have a supported Atheros card, but support only runs up to High Sierra (Mojave works with AirportAtheros40 from High Sierra, but not with Catalina). The best option is getting a Broadcom card; see MykolaG's WiFi buyer's guide for recommendations. Samsung PM981 NVMe SSDs These SSDs are not compatible (causing kernel panics) and they need updated firmware for a fix; however, since it is a OEM SSD Samsung does not release firmware to end users and no OEM has been found shipping firmware with a fix. On a related note, Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe SSDs also had the same problem but it was fixed in a firmware update; get the update (Windows via Samsung Magician or bootable ISO) here. Also to note, laptops that use Intel Optane Memory or Micron 3D XPoint for HDD acceleration are unsupported in macOS. These drives MUST be removed or else macOS won't boot at all. Thunderbolt USB C ports (Hackintosh) Thunderbolt support is currently still iffy in macOS, even more so with Alpine Ridge controllers, which most current laptops have. There have been attempts to keep the controller powered on, which allows Thunderbolt and USB C hotplug to work, but it comes at the cost of kernel panics and/or USB C breaking after sleep. If you want to use the USB C side of the port and be able to sleep, you must plug it in at boot and keep it plugged in. Note: This does not apply to USB C only ports - only Thunderbolt 3 and USB C combined ports. Windows Hello Face Recognition Some laptops come with WHFR that is I2C connected (and used through your iGPU), those will not work. Some laptops come with WHFR that is USB connected, if you're lucky, you may get the camera functionality, but nothing else. Intel Smart Sound Technology Laptops with Intel SST will not have anything connected through them (usually internal mic) work, as it is not supported. You can check with Device Manager on Windows. Headphone Jack Combo Some laptops with a combo headphone jack may not get Audio Input through them and will have to either use the built-in microphone or an external Audio Input device through USB.

"},"overview/requirements.html":{"url":"overview/requirements.html","title":"Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Requirements Before you start tinkering with your laptop, make sure you have prepared the following: Physical requirements [CRUCIAL] A functioning brain [CRUCIAL] Time and patience. Don't start working on this if you have deadlines or important work. We are not responsible of the waste of time and any data lost during this process. [CRUCIAL] KNOW YOUR HARDWARE Your CPU name, generation Your RAM size (and slots used if needed) Your GPUs (All of them, Intel, AMD, Nvidia. You may have 2 GPUs, only the Intel one will work, no questions asked) Your storage devices (HDD/SSD, SATA/M.2, NVME/AHCI/RAID/IDE configuration. Note: Only NVME and AHCI/M.2 or AHCI/SATA will work. Other configurations may be harder to get by. RST users need to disable it, it can be named Intel Rapid Storage, RST or RAID) Your screen resolution Your audio codec Your laptop model Your LAN or Ethernet chipset Your WLAN/BT chipset [CRUCIAL] A BASIC KNOWLEDGE ON COMMAND LINES AND HOW TO USE A TERMINAL/COMMAND PROMPT This is not just [CRUCIAL], this is the basis of this whole guide. Don't come crying at me because you don't know how to cd to a directory or delete a file. [CRUCIAL] A machine that is compatible as seen in the Compatibilty section. [CRUCIAL] A minimum of: 8GB USB if you're going to follow the offline method 4GB USB if you're going to follow the online method Note: if you have a rooted android phone, look for DriveDroid, and make sure you have a shared internal storage (no separate /data partition) usually all phones made after 2012 should be like that, so if yours is fairly new it will handle it just fine. Note2: use a USB2.0 drive, HDDs may not be a good choice, also if you don't have any USB2.0, plug the USB in a USB2.0 port if available, or use a USB extension cord that doesn't support USB3.0, this way the USB3.0 drive will run in USB2.0 mode. [CRUCIAL] An Ethernet connection (no wifi, no wifi dongles, Ethernet USB adapter may work depending on macOS support) and you must know your LAN card's model (and your internet speed) You must either have a physical lan port, or a compatible macOS ethernet dongle/adapter, or in case your have a compatible wifi card, it's also good but not recommended (unless it's the only way to go) For people who can't use ethernet but have an android phone, you can connect your android phone to WiFi and then tether it using USB. For iOS users: (taken from Carcraftz) iOS users can do this as well but you need the Tetherme tweak on a jailbroken iPhone. Unfortnunately if you are not on the right version (any ios version up to 12.1.2) this is not possible. :/ A fast internet connection Users have complained of slow or locked up downloads, that's mainly due to slow or unstable internet. This is crucial for the online method, offline can get away with it. A Proper OS Installation: Be it: macOS (a fairly recent one would be better) Windows (Windows 10, 1703 or newer) Linux (with python2.7 or later), make sure it's clean and properly functioning. For online installer, 15GB of free space on the drive you're working on. On Windows, your OS disk (C:) must have 15GB free at least. For offline installer, 30GB of free space on macOS's drive. Some googling skills, which a lot of you lack sadly. Non-physical requirements For offline installer A macOS environment: Hack Mac (recommended) VM (not really recommended, but if you have to, then you gotta use what you have) 30GB of free space Python 2.7 or greater (you already have that on macOS) ProperTree [Recommended]: a simple tool to edit plist files, from /u/corpnewt https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree Or text editor: Notepad++, Sublime Text, VSCode... Note: on October/fall 2018 Windows Update, the native notepad can work too. Older versions of windows must use a 3rd party text editor. If you don't know what this is, get a one of the text editors above. For online installer Python 2.7 or greater: For Windows, get it from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and make sure you enable \"add to PATH\" in the install DO NOT use the python release in the Microsoft Store, get it from the official website. For linux users, install it if you don't have it following your distro's tools For macOS users, you already have 2.7+ version installed, no need for extra tools ProperTree [Recommended]: a simple tool to edit plist files, from /u/corpnewt https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree Or text editor: Notepad++, Sublime Text, VSCode... Note: on October/fall 2018 Windows Update, the native notepad can work too. Older versions of windows must use a 3rd party text editor. If you don't know what this is, get a one of the text editors above. gibMacOS: a sweet tool from /u/corpnewt https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS if you have git on windows use it to clone the repo if you don't, press Clone or Download button and download as Zip, extract it somewhere Other software requirements will be downloaded thorough the guide (OS specific) "},"overview/terminology.html":{"url":"overview/terminology.html","title":"Terminology","keywords":"","body":"Terminology macOS: Apple's own OS used for Mac machines and \"What makes a Mac a Mac\". Windows: Microsoft's proprietary OS that is used and supported on a wide range of devices (stay with this OS if you don't want headaches) Linux: is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution. (sauce: trusty Wikipedia) Distros: short for Distributions, although it's not something that is bad, Linux distros are how linux is distributed, however when it comes to macOS, it's a mixed macOS installer with a bunch of tools that are not from Apple, do not use macOS Distros Hackintosh: the process of installing macOS onto a PC, note that hackintosh IS NOT the OS, it is also refered to the machine that was \"hacked\" to get macOS running on it. EG: I installed macOS on this Windows machine, therfore I made a hackintosh. But I did NOT install \"hackintosh\". Bootloader: a piece of software that loads an OS, usually made by the OS creators. Clover IS NOT a bootloader per se (explanation down bellow). Boot Manager: a piece of software that manages bootloaders, and we have many of those: Clover, Systemd-boot, OpenCore, rEFInd, rEFIt... CLOVER: a piece of software made by the Clover team that have a lot of features like patching and/or booting macOS/OS X/Mac OS X, Windows and Unix/Linux OSes and many other features. It is the go-to boot manager for hackintoshing. OpenCore: the new hotness on the hackintosh scene, made with security in mind by the Acidanthera team, has faster booting and lighter weight than Clover. It is a lot more involved but also supports many Mac features a lot more natively than Clover (like Hibernation, FileVault2, Boot HotKeys...). ACPI: the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) provides an open standard that operating systems can use to discover and configure computer hardware components, to perform power management by (for example) putting unused components to sleep, and to perform status monitoring. (sauce: trusty Wikipedia) Kexts: also known as Kernel Extensions, it's macOS's drivers. They're used to perform different tasks like device drivers or for a different purpose (in hackintoshing) like patching the OS or injecting information or running tasks. Kexts are not the only playing factor in a good hackintosh, they're sometimes paired with ACPI patches and fixes. BIOS: Basic Input/Output System, is firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup), and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a personal computer's system board, and it is the first software to run when powered on. (sauce: trusty Wikipedia) It's a Legacy piece of software that was made back in the 70s and still used to this day due to its maturity. UEFI: The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI replaces the legacy Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface originally present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers, with most UEFI firmware implementations providing support for legacy BIOS services. UEFI can support remote diagnostics and repair of computers, even with no operating system installed. (sauce: trusty Wikipedia) UEFI Drivers: Like any other OS, UEFI have drivers and they're loaded by Clover or OpenCore, they're also meant to load devices or perform other tasks like patching macOS's boot.efi and so on. You may find them as Clover Driver or OpenCore Drivers, they're all UEFI drivers. (Note: use the drivers that are meant for that specific boot manager). EFI: It can denote two things: Mac's firmware, which the same as UEFI, but pretty modified for Macs only, so not so \"Universal\" The partition on your hard drive that stores software read by the UEFI to load OSes (like windows bootloader) or UEFI Applications (like Clover), it's FAT32 formatted and has an ID type of EF00 (in hex). Can be named ESP or SYSTEM partition, and it's sized from 100MB to 400MB usually but the size doesn't reflect the function of it (it all depends on the OEMs and OS choices when installing.) MBR: Master Boot Record is a special type of boot sector at the very beginning of partitioned computer mass storage devices like fixed disks or removable drives intended for use with IBM PC-compatible systems and beyond. The concept of MBRs was publicly introduced in 1983 with PC DOS 2.0. The MBR holds the information on how the logical partitions, containing file systems, are organized on that medium. The MBR also contains executable code to function as a loader for the installed operating systemâ€”usually by passing control over to the loader's second stage, or in conjunction with each partition's volume boot record (VBR). This MBR code is usually referred to as a boot loader. (sauce: trusty Wikipedia) This format is used on BIOS/Legacy setups. The MBT format supports a maximum of 2TiB of size and a max of 4 Primary partitions. GPT: GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a standard for the layout of partition tables of a physical computer storage device, such as a hard disk drive or solid-state drive, using universally unique identifiers, which are also known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs). Forming a part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard (Unified EFI Forum-proposed replacement for the PC BIOS), it is nevertheless also used for some BIOS systems, because of the limitations of master boot record (MBR) partition tables, which use 32 bits for logical block addressing (LBA) of traditional 512-byte disk sectors. (sauce: trusty Wikipedia) Usually this is the disk format you want to use on a UEFI system.
