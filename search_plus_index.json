Fingerprint sensors There is no way to emulate the Touch ID sensor as of currently, so fingerprint sensors will not work. Discrete GPUs 90% of discrete GPUs will not work because they are wired in a configuration that macOS doesn't support (switchable graphics). With NVIDIA discrete GPUs, this is usually called Optimus. It is not possible to utilize these dGPUs for the internal display, so it is generally advised to disable them and power them off (will be covered later in this guide.) However, in some cases, the discrete GPU powers any external outputs (HDMI, mini DisplayPort, etc.), which may or may not work; in the case that it will work, you will have to keep the card on and running. However, there are some laptops which rarely do not have switchable graphics, so the discrete card can be used (if supported by macOS), but the wiring and setup usually causes issues. AMD CPU laptops AMD CPU laptops, while theoretically able to work, are not practical for the following reasons: No CPU power management, so battery life will be bad Non-native support, requiring kernel patches, resulting in delayed updates No support for AMD integrated graphics (Radeon R5, R7, etc.) Most WiFi cards (or say Intel?) Most WiFi cards that come with laptops are not supported as they are usually Intel/Qualcomm. If you are lucky, you may have a supported Atheros card, but support only runs up to Mojave. The best option is getting a Broadcom card; see MykolaG's WiFi buyer's guide for recommendations.

"},"requirements.html":{"url":"requirements.html","title":"Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Requirements Before you start tinkering with your laptop, make sure you have prepared the following: Physical requirements [CRUCIAL] A functioning brain [CRUCIAL] Time and patience. Don't start working on this if you have deadlines or important work. We are not responsible of the waste of time and any data lost during this process. [CRUCIAL] KNOW YOUR HARDWARE Your CPU name, generation Your RAM size (and slots used if needed) Your GPUs (All of them, Intel, AMD, Nvidia. You may have 2 GPUs, only the Intel one will work, no questions asked) Your storage devices (HDD/SSD, SATA/M.2, NVME/AHCI/RAID/IDE configuration. Note: Only NVME and AHCI/M.2 or AHCI/SATA will work. Other configurations may be harder to get by. RST users need to disable it, it can be named Intel Rapid Storage, RST or RAID) Your screen resolution Your audio codec Your laptop model Your LAN or Ethernet chipset Your WLAN/BT chipset [CRUCIAL] A BASIC KNOWLEDGE ON COMMAND LINES AND HOW TO USE A TERMINAL/COMMAND PROMPT This is not just [CRUCIAL], this is the basis of this whole guide. Dont come crying at me because you dont know how to cd to a directory or delete a file. [CRUCIAL] A machine that is compatible as seen in the Compatibilty section. [CRUCIAL] A minimum of: 8GB USB if you're going to follow the offline method 4GB USB if you're going to follow the online method Note: if you have a rooted android phone, look for DriveDroid, and make sure you have a shared internal storage (no separate /data partition) usually all phones made after 2012 should be like that, so if yours is fairly new it will handle it just fine. Note2: use a USB2.0 drive, HDDs may not be a good choice, also if you don't have any USB2.0, plug the USB in a USB2.0 port if available, or use a USB extension cord that doesn't support USB3.0, this way the USB3.0 drive will run in USB2.0 mode. [CRUCIAL] An Ethernet connection (no wifi, no wifi dongles, Ethernet USB adapter may work depending on macOS support) and you must know your LAN card's model (and your internet speed) You must either have a physical lan port, or a compatible macOS ethernet dongle/adapter, or in case your have a compatible wifi card, it's also good but not recommended (unless it's the only way to go) For people who can't use ethernet but have an android phone, you can connect your android phone to WiFi and then tether it using USB. For iOS users: (taken from Carcraftz) iOS users can do this as well but you need the Tetherme tweak on a jailbroken iPhone. Unfortnunately if you are not on the right version (any ios version up to 12.1.2) this is not possible. :/ A fast internet connection Users have complained of slow or locked up downloads, that's mainly due to slow or unstable internet. This is crucial for the online method, offline can get away with it. A Proper OS Installation: Be it: macOS (a fairly recent one would be better) Windows (Windows 10, 1703 or newer) Linux (with python2.7 or later), make sure it's clean and properly functioning. For online installer, 15GB of free space on the drive you're working on. On Windows, your OS disk (C:) must have 15GB free at least. For offline installer, 30GB of free space on macOS's drive. Some googling skills, which a lot of you lack sadly. Non-physical requirements For offline installer A macOS environment: Hack Mac (recommended) VM (not really recommended, but if you have to, then you gotta use what you have) 30GB of free space Python 2.7 or greater (you already have that on macOS) ProperTree [Recommended]: a simple tool to edit plist files, from /u/corpnewt https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree Or text editor: Notepad++, Sublime Text, VSCode... Note: on October/fall 2018 Windows Update, the native notepad can work too. Older versions of windows must use a 3rd party text editor. If you dont know what this is, get a one of the text editors above. For online installer Python 2.7 or greater: For Windows, get it from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and make sure you enable \"add to PATH\" in the install NOTE: There seem to be a bug in 1903 release of Windows, if the .bat file doesn't load for you, just open a new PS/CMD window (as admin), and run python from the guide. DO NOT use the python release in the Microsoft Store, get it from the official website. For linux users, install it if you dont have it following your distro's tools For macOS users, you already have 2.7+ version installed, no need for extra tools ProperTree [Recommended]: a simple tool to edit plist files, from /u/corpnewt https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree Or text editor: Notepad++, Sublime Text, VSCode... Note: on October/fall 2018 Windows Update, the native notepad can work too. Older versions of windows must use a 3rd party text editor. If you dont know what this is, get a one of the text editors above. gibMacOS: a sweet tool from /u/corpnewt https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS if you have git on windows use it to clone the repo if you dont, press Clone or Download button and download as Zip, extract it somewhere Other software requirements will be downloaded thorough the guide (OS specific) "},"terminology.html":{"url":"terminology.html","title":"Terminology","keywords":"","body":"Terminology Clover: a bootloader for macOS "},"page/":{"url":"page/","title":"page","keywords":"","body":"page "},"page/page-under-it.html":{"url":"page/page-under-it.html","title":"page under it","keywords":"","body":"page under it "},"new-group/1.html":{"url":"new-group/1.html","title":"1","keywords":"","body":"1 "},"new-group/2.html":{"url":"new-group/2.html","title":"2","keywords":"","body":"2 "},"new-group/3.html":{"url":"new-group/3.html","title":"3","keywords":"","body":"3 "}}
