So you want to hackintosh a laptop? Can't wrap your head around RehabMan's confusing guides? Well, here's the vanila laptop guide for you. This guide will explain everything you need to know to hackintosh a laptop. For Windows and Linux we will use the internet install method, and for macOS we will use `createinstallmedia` (offline install).

## Before you begin

### **KNOW YOUR HARDWARE**

We can't stress this enough. If you don't know your hardware and don't know how to find it, hackintoshing probably isn't for you. Device Manager, [Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) and google are your friends here.

### **READ TWICE AND CAREFULLY BEFORE ASKING**

This is not a very welcoming community for people who do not want to do some self-study and learn from other's findings and instead wait for someone to spoon-feed them information and make things work for them. Read The Fucking Manual and work your way through it and do some intense googling.

If you're ready, get to the next step.

Good Luck! ðŸŽŠ
